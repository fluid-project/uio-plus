can also be run as an unpacked extension.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Testing

### Node

Run the node-based tests:

```bash
node tests/node/all-tests.js
```

### Browser

Run the browser-based tests:

[http://localhost/tests/browser/all-tests.html](http://localhost/tests/browser/all-tests.html)

_**NOTE:** Browser tests should be served through a web server. The exact URL may vary._

### All tests with reports

Run all the tests and generate reports which can be viewed in the browser from the "reports" directory:

```bash
# run on the host machine
npm test
```
