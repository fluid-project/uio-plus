## Building the extension

### Dependencies

Install [grunt-cli](https://gruntjs.com) globally:

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Install required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Build

This will generate a `dist` directory at the root of the project. This is used when creating a published version, and
can also be run as an unpacked extension.

```bash
grunt build
```

## Testing

### Node

Run the node-based tests:

```bash
node tests/node/all-tests.js
```

### Browser

Run the browser-based tests:

[http://localhost/tests/browser/all-tests.html](http://localhost/tests/browser/all-tests.html)

_**NOTE:** Browser tests should be served through a web server. The exact URL may vary._

### All tests with reports

Run all the tests and generate reports which can be viewed in the browser from the "reports" directory:

```bash
# run on the host machine
npm test

# run in a vagrant vm
npm run test:vagrant
```

## Trying UIO+ in the browser

Requirements:

* [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)

Follow these steps if you want to use the unpacked version of the extension:

1. Visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extension) in your Chrome browser. Alternatively, open Chrome's menu by
   clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox; the menu's icon is three horizontal bars. Select *Extensions*
   under the *Tools* menu to open Chrome's extension settings.
2. Ensure that the *Developer mode* checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
3. Click *Load unpacked extension* to open a file-selection dialog.
4. Navigate to the directory in which your local copy of the extension lives, and select the `dist` folder.

_**NOTE:** Published versions can be installed from the [Chrome Web Store](
    https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ui-options-plus-uio%20/okenndailhmikjjfcnmolpaefecbpaek)._
